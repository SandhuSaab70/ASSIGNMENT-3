Staff Requisition System Overview
This Python program gathers staff details, generates a unique Requisition ID, and calculates the total cost of items requested. It also assesses whether the requisition should be approved based on its total value.

Workflow
Collect Staff Information:
The program begins by asking the user to provide staff details, including the date, Staff ID, and Staff Name.

Input Requisition Items:
The user is prompted to enter three requisition items, along with their quantity and price. The total cost of the requisition is then calculated.

Requisition Approval:
If the total cost is $500 or less, the requisition is automatically approved. If it exceeds $500, the requisition is marked as pending.

Display Information:
Finally, the program displays all collected staff and requisition information, including the total value of the requisition.
